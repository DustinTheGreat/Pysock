# About
This is a command line tool for finding common vulnerabilities in applications using websockets.
From my experience the tools surrounding websockets are unintuitive, making them hard to work with without
a good understaning of the protocol or the WS server itself. This tool is intended to automate the enumeration
process for you. 



# Install
```
  virtualenv -p python3
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python pysock.py -u IP/DN
```
# Usage
Currently this program is expecting  that you already know the ip address or hostname && PORT of the websockets server. With this knowledge, you can run the tool.
## Parameters:
             
# Contribution


# Testing
You can also try the tool on your localhost by starting the server in /scripts.
`python server.py`
