# Top Vulnerabilities (Priortized in search)

## Authorization/Authentication

Client demands/Server responds, check and see what the permissions are looking like.

##  Encryption/Encoding

This is probably the first thing we need to look for when designing the framework, all sockets should be upgraded to wss:// if not we can sniff all incoming/outgoing traffic.


## Malicious Input Attacks

Check to see if all data is properly sanitized.
